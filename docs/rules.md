# Rules
## Teams
* a **match** can be played by 2 teams of 2 players or by 2 individual players (2 teams of 1 player).
* In the rest of this document I will always refer to **teams**. 
* The scoring rules don't depend on the number of players in the teams.

## Basic scoring rules
* 4 **points** win a **game**
* 6 **games** win a **set**
* 2 or 3 **sets** win a **match** (the necessary score is decided beforehand)

## Points rules
* points are 0, 15, 30, 40

### Deuce
* if both teams have 40 points, **deuce** is called.
* the first that scores at deuce, gets **advantage-in** (also marked with 40A)
* if the same team scores, it's **game** (they get 1 game point)
* if the opponent team scores, it's deuce again.

## Game points
* points are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 
* if one of the teams has 6 points with a difference of at least 2 points (e.g. 6-4, 6-3 etc.), it's *set* (the team gains 1 set point)
* if game score is 5-5, the set can be won for 7-5.
* if the game score is 6-6, it's tie-break. The set can be won by the first team that wins a game (unless it's the final set)
* at the final set there is no tie-break. The set is won by the first team that has at least 6 game points and win with 2 points of difference (6-4, 7-5, 18-16, 1000-998 etc.)

## Sets
* 2 or 3 sets win the match, so there can be **minimum** 2 or 3 sets, and **maximum** 3 or 5 sets
